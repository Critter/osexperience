# OS Experience

OS Experience (commonly shortened to OSE) is a somewhat popular window manager and switcher I created for iOS 6 and 7.

It is my personal ideology to release the source code of all my work once I deem it no longer profitable for me. I do not see myself updating OSE for iOS 8 and above. The source code took me a year of writing and a year of learning to procure, and due to the large amount of changes in iOS 8 (including the new FrontBoard framework), along with iOS 9's new multitasking features, I have decided not to update OSE. However, the community paid me money for the tweak, so the least I can do is give them the code to the software they paid money for.

So, here it is! Have at it! It may be a bit confusing and hackish, but it got the job done. It was never intended for open source, so I didn't write the code specifically in a way to be read by anyone but myself. Also, keep in mind the code was written over the course of a year. My coding style changed greatly over time.

Enjoy! Send me an email if you have any questions. I'll answer them as best I can.

(P.S. , if you make anything useful with this source code, don't hesitate to let me know! I'd be delighted if this helped somebody out.)
